Recommendation of changes to existing CS courses or propose a new CS course: 
- Such a report must clearly identify new topics to be covered, with corresponding suggested lecture notes, and lab / homework / project examples. Discuss to how such changes could lead to better integration of topics across the two courses and why these additions are beneficial. Propose at least one assignment per project member related to the integration of concepts.

- The faculty reviewer can judge the appropriateness of the proposed new material. The focus of the evaluation should be on whether students show in-depth understanding of the connections among concepts between the two courses, and whether the materials would be effective in helping other students learn the associated concepts, and not on whether the faculty member actually believes these courses changes should be implemented.

- If proposing changes to an existing class, then one week of lecture material per project member is expected.

- One option is to propose a new course; in this case, a detailed syllabus and a week's worth of material per team member would constitute an acceptable project.

An acceptable project will include most of the following:
1. Identify a week of material per team member that integrates the courses.

2. Provide an outline of how the material in question could be taught.

3. Provide the description of a take-home assignment per week of material.

4. If this will be added to a current course, identify material that can be removed to make room.

5. If this will be added in a new course, list major topics that will fill the rest of the course and the new course's prerequisites.
